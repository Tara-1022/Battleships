# Battleships
A command-line game of Battleships!

The game consists of a 5x5 board, with rows labelled 1 to 5, and columns labelled A to E. The player enters the coordinates of a cell they wish to attack. Empty cells display '0' when hit, while cells that belong to a ship display '1'. Hit all occupied cells of the 4x1, 3x1 and 2x1 ships to win, trying to do so in the least number of moves.

To play, download and run the Battleships.exe file.
